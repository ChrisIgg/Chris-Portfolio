      <p>
        I’m a multi-media artist with a background in many audio-visual and
        technical fields. In searching to learn the many ways the world
        communicates to each other, I’ve found myself producing/broadcasting
        local television in the public sector, a contractor for architectural
        photography, a gigging musician around NYC, an editor/producer of video
        content in the commercial field, and also developing a burgeoning career
        in tech and code-based languages.
