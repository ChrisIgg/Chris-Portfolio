      <p>
        I’m a multi-media artist with a background in many audio-visual and
        technical fields. I’ve found myself producing/broadcasting local
        television in the public sector, a contractor for architectural
        photography, a gigging musician around NYC, an editor/producer of video
        content in the commercial field, and I am now developing a burgeoning
        career in computer programming.
